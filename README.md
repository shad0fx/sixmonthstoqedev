Repository of my journey from manual tester to Quality Engineer / Developer

I set forth to become a front-end developer in 6 months. Utilizing tools such as Udemy, Test Automation University, Test Rail, Free Code Camp, and others. 
The idea is to improve myself from a manual tester to either an automation tester or a full stack developer. 
Long term I'd like to turn what I have learned to develop and develop a means to showcase my development and interactive fiction writing. Inspired by text adventure games like Zork, A Dark Room, Amnesia, and others.   

The current road map. Start with basics and expand out from there.
